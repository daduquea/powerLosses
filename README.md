# powerLosses
In this repository, we provide the code to train a segmentation model based on an unet architecture. There can be changed several parameters including the loss function in order to test the influence of the power term during training.
It is necessary to unzip the data folder before running the notebook.

This code is provided as a complemental material for the paper "On power losses for semantic segmentation" by David Duque-Arias, Santiago Velasco-Forero, Jean-Emmanuel Deschaud, Francois Goulette, Andres Serna, Etienne Decenciere and Beatriz Marcotegui from PSL Research University and Terra3D Research.
